# SaveMe (app for IOS Swift)
## an app I developed two years ago,with two friends.
#### The app is connected to FireBase servers by google, the app know to receives data in real time and displays it on the screen
###### probably the app didnt work as its work 2 years ago, for several reason ( software updating , certificate issues)
